    Professional Experience
    Current Job: AI Engineer at Guild Mortgage
    •	As one of the key technical architects behind GuildIQ, I'm helping revolutionize knowledge access by developing a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that transforms how teams interact with critical information. I've implemented comprehensive full-stack optimization strategies across the framework, significantly boosting document processing speeds, reducing response times, and cutting operational overhead through efficient resource management. This innovative approach reshaped internal workflows and set a new benchmark for leveraging AI in operational environments.
